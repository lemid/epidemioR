The extension package drc for the statistical environment R provides a flexible and versatile infrastructure for dose-response analyses in general. The present version of the package, reflecting extensions and modifications over the last decade, provides a user-friendly interface to specify the model assumptions about the dose-response relationship and comes with a number of extractors for summarizing fitted models and carrying out inference on derived parameters. The aim of the present paper is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art dose-response analysis, both in terms of general concepts that have evolved and matured over the years and by means of concrete examples.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Koninklijke Nederlandse Planteziektenkundige Vereniging. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a standard area diagram set (SADs) to assess the severity of peach rust, caused by Tranzschelia discolor. The proposed SADs includes ten images of leaves with a range of severity (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30{\%}). The SADs was validated by 14 raters who had no experience in plant disease severity estimation. In the first step of the validation, the raters made severity estimates of 50 leaves with a range of rust severity without using SADs. In the second step, the same raters estimated severity of rust on the same 50 leaves using the SADs to aid estimation. Lin's concordance correlation analysis showed that both precision and accuracy improved when the raters used the SADs compared to the assessments made without SADs. Accuracy, as measured by the coefficient of bias (C b ) improved from 0.70 to 0.98, without and with SADs, respectively, and precision measured by the correlation coefficient (r) improved from 0.85 to 0.90, without and with SADs, respectively. Overall agreement, measured by Lin's concordance correlation coefficient ($\rho$ c ), improved from 0.59 to 0.88 without and with SADs, respectively. Furthermore, estimates were more reliable when using SADs: the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) was 0.60 without and 0.73 with SADs; and the intra-class correlation coefficient ($\rho$) was 0.72 without, and 0.86 with SADs. Thus, the use of SADs improved the precision, accuracy and reliability of visual estimates of severity of peach rust.},

Validation was performed using a sequence of 50 images assessed by 16 raters with no previous experience in quantifying plant disease severity. By Lin's concordance correlation coefficient analysis, there was an improvement in u (no SADs = 0.361, with SADs = −0.030), $\upsilon$ (no SADs = 1.456, with SADs = 0.997), Cb (no SADs = 0.864, with SADs = 0.979), r (no SADs = 0.897, with SADs = 0.937) and $\rho$c (no SADs = 0.774, with SADs = 0.918) parameters, showing an increase in accuracy and precision of the estimated disease severity using SADs when compared to the non-use of SADs. Reliability improvement was also observed, with increase in R2 values when SADs were used (no SADs = 0.790, with SADs = 0.846). Therefore, SADs improved accuracy, precision and reliability of grape downy mildew severity estimates in Vitis labrusca.},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to elaborate and validate a diagrammatic scale to quantify the severity of orange rust of sugarcane and to compare its efficiency in assessing the disease with the scale of brown rust. For the design of the scale, 120 sugarcane leaves were collected from a susceptible cultivar and the highest and the lowest severity founded were selected as extremes of scale. The intermediate levels were calculated according to the law of Weber-Fechner. The scale was proposed with nine levels of severity: 0,06; 0,14; 0,36; 0,89; 2,17; 5,18; 11,87; 24,92 and 45,00{\%}. The validation was accomplished by eight appraisers who estimated the severity of 120 leaves in three assessments: without scale, with scale of brown rust and with the proposed diagrammatic scale. The scale proposed was more efficient than the scale of brown rust to assess the severity of this disease, providing an average coefficient of determination (R2) of 0,91 and absence of constant and systematic errors. With the scale of brown rust, the average R2 was 0,84 and three appraisers committed constant errors. Moreover, with the scale proposed, approximately 92{\%} of the estimates of the appraisers had been in the range of variation of 5{\%} of the value of real severity, while in the assessments without scale and with scale of brown rust, approximately 78{\%} and 84{\%} of the estimates were in that range, respectively. {\textcopyright} Brazilian Phytopathological Society.},
