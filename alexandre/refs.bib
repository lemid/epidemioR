The present version of the package, reflecting extensions and modifications over the last decade, provides a user-friendly interface to specify the model assumptions about the dose-response relationship and comes with a number of extractors for summarizing fitted models and carrying out inference on derived parameters. The aim of the present paper is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art dose-response analysis, both in terms of general concepts that have evolved and matured over the years and by means of concrete examples.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Koninklijke Nederlandse Planteziektenkundige Vereniging. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a standard area diagram set (SADs) to assess the severity of peach rust, caused by Tranzschelia discolor. The proposed SADs includes ten images of leaves with a range of severity (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30{\%}). The SADs was validated by 14 raters who had no experience in plant disease severity estimation. In the first step of the validation, the raters made severity estimates of 50 leaves with a range of rust severity without using SADs. In the second step, the same raters estimated severity of rust on the same 50 leaves using the SADs to aid estimation. Lin's concordance correlation analysis showed that both precision and accuracy improved when the raters used the SADs compared to the assessments made without SADs. Accuracy, as measured by the coefficient of bias (C b ) improved from 0.70 to 0.98, without and with SADs, respectively, and precision measured by the correlation coefficient (r) improved from 0.85 to 0.90, without and with SADs, respectively. Overall agreement, measured by Lin's concordance correlation coefficient ($\rho$ c ), improved from 0.59 to 0.88 without and with SADs, respectively. Furthermore, estimates were more reliable when using SADs: the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) was 0.60 without and 0.73 with SADs; and the intra-class correlation coefficient ($\rho$) was 0.72 without, and 0.86 with SADs. Thus, the use of SADs improved the precision, accuracy and reliability of visual estimates of severity of peach rust.},

Reliability improvement was also observed, with increase in R2 values when SADs were used (no SADs = 0.790, with SADs = 0.846). Therefore, SADs improved accuracy, precision and reliability of grape downy mildew severity estimates in Vitis labrusca.},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to elaborate and validate a diagrammatic scale to quantify the severity of orange rust of sugarcane and to compare its efficiency in assessing the disease with the scale of brown rust. For the design of the scale, 120 sugarcane leaves were collected from a susceptible cultivar and the highest and the lowest severity founded were selected as extremes of scale. The intermediate levels were calculated according to the law of Weber-Fechner. The scale was proposed with nine levels of severity: 0,06; 0,14; 0,36; 0,89; 2,17; 5,18; 11,87; 24,92 and 45,00{\%}. The validation was accomplished by eight appraisers who estimated the severity of 120 leaves in three assessments: without scale, with scale of brown rust and with the proposed diagrammatic scale. The scale proposed was more efficient than the scale of brown rust to assess the severity of this disease, providing an average coefficient of determination (R2) of 0,91 and absence of constant and systematic errors. With the scale of brown rust, the average R2 was 0,84 and three appraisers committed constant errors. Moreover, with the scale proposed, approximately 92{\%} of the estimates of the appraisers had been in the range of variation of 5{\%} of the value of real severity, while in the assessments without scale and with scale of brown rust, approximately 78{\%} and 84{\%} of the estimates were in that range, respectively. {\textcopyright} Brazilian Phytopathological Society.},

We report the draft genome sequence of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita, a biotrophic parasite of many crops, including tomato, cotton and coffee. Most of the assembled sequence of this asexually reproducing nematode, totaling 86 Mb, exists in pairs of homologous but divergent segments. This suggests that ancient allelic regions in M. incognita are evolving toward effective haploidy, permitting new mechanisms of adaptation. The number and diversity of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes in M. incognita is unprecedented in any animal for which a genome sequence is available, and may derive from multiple horizontal gene transfers from bacterial sources. Our results provide insights into the adaptations required by metazoans to successfully parasitize immunocompetent plants, and open the way for discovering new antiparasitic strategies. {\textcopyright} 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Presently, more than 925 million people around the world face extreme hunger and 2 billion people lack adequate food security. The first and foremost objective of the millennium development goals (MDGs) set in 2000 is to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger by the year 2015. Three years to the target date, plant-parasitic nematodes pose enormous threats to global food security, destroying at least 12.3{\%} of global food production annually. This is estimated to be more than US{\$}157 billion worldwide. Nematode diseases of crops are difficult to control because of the insidious nature of nematodes, and their diagnostic symptoms closely resemble that of other pathogens and abiotic diseases. In order to effectively combat nematodes pests, it is necessary to define the problem in order to correctly search for lasting management strategies. The food insecurity facing millions of people especially in developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America is real. Finding lasting solution to this problem presents a daunting challenge for nematologists. The challenges of the future lies in increasing knowledge of nematodes and to use this knowledge in training, research and development (R{\&}D) of new technologies, methods and strategies to be used in effective and sustainable control of the plant parasitic nematodes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {One of the most important objectives of the goals of Millennium Development Goals is to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. Sufficient nourishment for the whole population of the world is one of the challenges of the present era. According to an estimate plant parasitic nematodes are causing much more damage annually compared to insect pests. A crop yield loss due to these tiny unseen pests in various countries is enormous. They caused projected yield loss of 12.3{\%} ({\$}157 billion dollars) worldwide. Out of which {\$}40.3 million is reported from India. Farmers/growers identified insect pests, and other constraints as production problems but overlooked plant parasitic nematodes. Nematode diseases are difficult to control because of their hidden nature and hence, more often overlooked. Plant parasitic nematodes not only cause damage individually but form disease-complexes with other micro-organism and increased the crop loss. Also the symptoms of nematode damage are not specific, resemble with the symptoms of other pathogens and abiotic stresses such as water and mineral deficiency. Future agricultural growth must come from productivity growth to address the persistent problems of poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition. Recommended measures against nematode diseases include use of clean nematode free planting material, resistant varieties, and crop rotations to suppress nematode infestation. Integrated nematode management can be promoted through farmers-nematologists interactions, local production of bio-control agents and strict chemical pesticide regulations. Farmer's/grower's awareness and skills are equally important in minimizing nematode infestation and yield losses, to sustain the agriculture production.},

This may reveal populations of nematodes with different genetic backgrounds compared to cultivated fields. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the genetic variability and aggressiveness of isolates of Meloidogyne spp., contrasting nematodes from preserved areas of the Cerrado with those originating from cultivated soybean fields. Cluster analysis separated isolates of Meloidogyne spp. and isolates from Cerrado and soybean but did not separate an aggressive Meloidogyne morocciensis isolate. The aggressiveness of six selected populations of Meloidogyne spp. from Cerrado and soybean against soybean cultivars was evaluated. Results showed that populations of M. javanica and M. incognita from Cerrado and soybean showed similar aggressiveness. However, for M. morocciensis, the population from soybean was much more aggressive than the one from Cerrado. Aggressiveness is a very intriguing subject that needs special attention for future research in nematology.},

@article{TRUDGILL2001,
abstract = {Most apomictic root-knot nematodes (RKN; Meloidogyne spp.) have host ranges that encompass the majority of flowering plants, and M. incognita is possibly the world's most damaging crop pathogen. The ancestors, age, and origins of the polyphagous RKN are obscure, but there is increasing evidence that M. incognita, M. javanica, and M. arenaria are closely related, heterogeneous species with a recent, hybrid (reticulate) origin. If so, they must owe much of their current worldwide distributions to spread by agriculture. Host resistance appears to be generally durable in the field, but laboratory studies suggest that apomixis does not prevent evolution in response to selection by a parasitic bacterium (Pasteuria penetrans) and host resistance. Maintaining general fitness may be the evolutionary priority for most populations of polyphagous RKN, and a wide host range, important in the field but not in the laboratory, may be conserved by apomixis. Several factors may help confer a wide host range, including suppression of host resistance, perhaps as a consequence of the strength of the induced susceptible response. Resistance genes effective against RKN appear not to have resulted from coevolution. Rates of juvenile invasion and/or development are low in many wild and some crop plants, with the result that they are both poor hosts and sustain less damage. Overall, it is suggested that greater coordination, particularly of fundamental research, is required},

abstract = {This essay considers biotrophic cyst and root-knot nematodes in relation to their biology, host-parasite interactions and molecular genetics. These nematodes have to face the biological consequences of the physical constraints imposed by the soil environment in which they live while their hosts inhabit both above and below ground environments. The two groups of nematodes appear to have adopted radically different solutions to these problems with the result that one group is a host specialist and reproduces sexually while the other has an enormous host range and reproduces by mitotic parthenogenesis. We consider what is known about the modes of parasitism used by these nematodes and how it relates to their host range, including the surprising finding that parasitism genes in both nematode groups have been recruited from bacteria. The nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of these two nematode groups are very different and we consider how these findings relate to the biology of the organisms. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Based on an agronomic point of view, the analysis focuses on a description of agricultural factors and practices, rather than on biological processes. Several alternative techniques are considered, including sanitation, soil management, organic amendments, fertilization, biological control and heat-based methods. We analyzed the effects of each practice and interactions among techniques and found large variations among studies. Many practices are only partially effective for nematode control; thus, combining control methods in a systemic analysis presents a challenge.
